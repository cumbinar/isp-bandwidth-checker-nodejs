# Network Checker Daemon

It's a bandwidth, IP tracker and a bot daemon that is monitoring the network peformance in a server, built upon JS instructions, it's intended to run periodically and save the results in a json file.

It makes use of:

* **lowdb** as a lite db_init in json format.
* **speedtest-cli** to run the speed tests from the command line.
* **pm2** process manager to run this script as a daemon system.

If you work with multiple projects and different development environments, I endorse you to use *versioning manager systems* like [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for NodeJS, [PYENV](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for Python, [RBENV](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) for Ruby and others to easily handle and switch among different versions of your favorite programming languages and its development backgrounds.

## Requirements

* Latest version of **[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)** *-- (npm included)*

* Latest version of **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** *-- (pip included)*

---

## Installation

* Install **[SpeedTest-cli](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli)**: `pip install speedtest-cli` 
* Install **[PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/)** globally: `npm install -g pm2` 

* Install **[LowDB](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb)**: Run `npm install` from the terminal, it makes use of the *package.json* in the source directory or if you prefer, follow the instructions from the provided link.
